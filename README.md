# 03 - Object Oriented Programming: Multi-class Programs
### Monday, Dec 18th

## Dreaded capitalism
___
Your program should have two separate classes: one to represent a product to be purchased and one to represent a shopping cart containing a collection of products.

Each product has a name, base price, and tax rate. There should also be a method to calculate and return the product's total price based on the base price and tax rate.

Each shopping cart has a collection of products. It should also have the following functionality:

  * add an product to the cart
  * remove an product from the cart
  * add up the total cost of all products in the cart before tax
  * add up the total cost of all products in the cart after tax  

Think about which class needs to make reference to the other one and remember to use a require statement accordingly. You don't need it in both files.
